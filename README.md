My last commit explains my test for the best game board available. The test runs over the game with the gameboard 100 times and takes the average of the value. The lowest one is the best one to choose. The values I got were:

[7 7 7 7 7] - 16
[6 6 6 6 6] - 18
[8 8 8 8 8] - 23
[10 11 12 7 8] - 35
[12 11 10 9 8] - 36
[10 7 7 8 8] - 24
[3 4 5 6 7] - 15

The best one was clearly the [3 4 5 6 7] board the second being [7 7 7 7 7].
